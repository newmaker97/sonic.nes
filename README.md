# Information
old build of mod folder with sonic.nes stuff so people stop asking me for it lol

## Will you ever release a new version? Like the ones on your YouTube?
No. Out of respect for the creators of the mods I use/chart/etc. I will not be releasing anything besides miniature updates like this one (and especially not publically, for both code stealing or afforementioned, respecting the original authors of the content.)

## How long do these typically take?
Anywhere from 3 hours to weeks. I pride myself in making the best quality I can, frequently updating my ports/charts.

## If I'm your friend, can I pretty please get the secret awesome stuff?
Well, since you asked so nicely...
