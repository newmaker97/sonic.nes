# THIS IS NOW OBSOLETE!
THIS MOD FOLDER IS NOW OUTDATED AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF RERUN TO MAKE YOUR OWN PORT (OR I WILL UPDATE IT ON RELEASE!!)
PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT OR ENCOURAGE LEAKS, FOLLOW THE TEAM AND BE PATIENT FOR ITS RELEASE! THIS MAY BE UPDATED WHEN THE FULL MOD IS OUT <3

# Information
old build of mod folder with sonic.nes stuff so people stop asking me for it lol

## Will you ever release a new version? Like the ones on your YouTube?
No. Out of respect for the creators of the mods I use/chart/etc. I will not be releasing anything besides miniature updates like this one (and especially not publically, for both code stealing or afforementioned, respecting the original authors of the content.)

## How long do these typically take?
Anywhere from 3 hours to weeks. I pride myself in making the best quality I can, frequently updating my ports/charts.

## Will you release more in the future?
Possibly.................................

## Is there an even more up-to-date version of this mod folder?
Yes, and GUESS WHOS NOT GETTING IT!!!! mwaahahawhahah

## Will this interfere with storage/other packs?
I tried to keep it as minimal as possible, saving storage and simplicity. The scripts folder has something for the score, you can drag it into the song folders (or delete it entirely) if you don't want the custom score stuff.

## If I'm your friend, can I pretty please get the secret awesome stuff?
Well, since you asked so nicely...
